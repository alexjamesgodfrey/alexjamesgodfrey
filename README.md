## I'm Alex, a sophomore at Cornell University <a href="http://alexgodfrey.com"><img style="float: right;" src="https://img.shields.io/website?label=alexgodfrey.com&style=for-the-badge&url=https://alexgodfrey.com"></a>

## Studyflow <a href="http://studyflow.ai"><img style="float: right;" src="https://img.shields.io/website?label=studyflow.ai&style=for-the-badge&url=https://studyflow.ai"></a>

<p>Studyflow started in the summer of 2021. I was trying to make my studying more efficient before I went off to college. I used a service called <a href="https://www.make.com/en" target="_blank">Integromat (now Make)</a> to automate my "Studyflow". The original studyflow was taking a note in <a>Notability</a>, automatically backing it up to <a>Google Drive</a>, creating a active recall template in <a>Notion</a>, and creating scheduled review tasks in <a>Todoist</a>.</p>
<p>This worked really well for me, so I wanted to share it. I made a Studyflow 0, a web app that replaced Integromat during my winter break. I used it to great success with my friend Charles in the following semester. Well, he wanted to share it too.</p>
<p>Introducing Studyflow, an all-in-one note-taking, task-managing, and social learning platform with the mission of increasing student productivity and well-being. You take a note on your iPad or computer, and Studyflow will automatically create a empty flashcards for you to fill out, schedule your review, and even share your notes with your friends and others in your class. It is the elements of Quizlet, Notion, and Todoist, all-in-one, specifically catered to students.<p>
