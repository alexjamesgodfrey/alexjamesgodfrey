<p>Studyflow started in the summer of 2021. I was trying to make my studying more efficient before I went off to college. I used a service called <a href="https://www.make.com/en" target="_blank">Integromat (now Make)</a> to automate my "Studyflow". The original studyflow was taking a note in <a href="https://notability.com/" target="_blank">Notability</a>, automatically backing it up to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, creating a active recall template in <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a>, and creating scheduled review tasks in <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p>This worked really well for me, so I wanted to share it. I made Studyflow 0, a web app that replaced Integromat during my winter break. I used it to great success with my friend Charles in the following semester. Well, he wanted to share it too. <b>But what if we could make all these features in one app, instead of 3? Also, these mega-companies don't make money off students. They focus on selling to firms.</b></p>
<p>Introducing Studyflow, an all-in-one note-taking, task-managing, and social learning platform with the mission of increasing student productivity and well-being. You take a note on your iPad or computer, and Studyflow will automatically create a empty flashcards for you to fill out, schedule your review, and even share your notes with your friends and others in your class. It is the elements of Quizlet, Notion, and Todoist, all-in-one, specifically catered to students.<p>
<p>Charles and I coded Studyflow 1.0 in the summer of 2022. I had about two years of web dev experience, him none at all. I helped him learn frontend as I was picking up Prisma, and GraphQL to serve the backend. Studyflow is written in Typescript, and uses NextJS, Prisma, and GraphQL frameworks to create a blazing fast and modern user experience.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 02/23:</strong>Studyflow has been dissolved in burning hot hydrochloric acid. We learned a lot and a had tons of fun, but would never be able to compete with <a href="https://remnote.io" target="_blank">Remnote</a>. If you can't beat 'em, join em!</p>
